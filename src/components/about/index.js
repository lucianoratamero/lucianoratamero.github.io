              I'm from Nova Friburgo, Brazil, and I love it here.
              it's a fairly small city on the mountains near Rio.
              cold enough in the winter, hot enough in the summer.
            </p>
            <p>
              I love tech, music, poetry, videogames and linux distros.
              and python. and javascript.
            </p>

              I've worked in several different roles and technologies,
              from restful backend python/django applications
              to frontend react SPAs.
            </p>

              I'm also the creator of a beautiful python lib called django_apistar.&nbsp;
